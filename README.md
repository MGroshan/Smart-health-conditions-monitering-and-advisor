# Smart-health-conditions-monitor-and-advisor

## Overview
This project develops a smart system for monitoring patient health and coordinating emergency responses, focusing on software solutions and cloud computing. It addresses the issue of delayed medical response by allowing manual data input and automating the alert process. 

## Problem Statement 

Delays in emergency medical response can be critical. Traditional monitoring methods often depend on IoT devices, but this project explores a solution that operates entirely through software, ensuring accessibility even without specialized hardware.

## Objective 1:
Develop a system that continuously monitors patient health metrics such as blood pressure, temperature, and oxygen levels.

## Objective 2: 
Implement an automatic alert system that identifies the most suitable hospital based on the patient’s condition. 

## Objective 3:
Ensure the system improves emergency response times through real-time data analysis and communication.

## Background Research:
Research on emergency response systems often focuses on IoT integration. However, there’s also significant work on cloud-based solutions that don’t require specialized hardware

## Key Findings: 
Studies have shown that while IoT can enhance healthcare, software solutions that use cloud computing and manual data input can be equally effective in certain contexts.

## Diagram: 
Include a system architecture diagram. Example:IoT Sensors: Collect patient vital signs.

## Mobile Application:
Interface for emergency responders to receive alerts and patient data.

## Cloud Database:
Stores and processes data.

## Alert System: 
Sends alerts to the hospital based on the patient's condition.

# Technologies Used: Flutter for the mobile app, Firebase for real-time database, IoT sensors for data collection.
 Examples:-
Patient data input screen. 
Alert received by hospital.
Hospital notification screen. 

-Scenario 1: A patient manually enters their health data into the app; the system detects.
-Scenario 2: Based on the patient's data, the system suggests the nearest hospital equipped to handle the condition.

## Outcomes:
The system successfully monitored patient vitals and generated alerts in real-time.
Reduced response times in simulated emergency situations.
## Challenges:
 -with real-world emergency services posed difficulties. 
-Ensuring data privacy and security was a major focus.
 Impact: The project demonstrates significant potential to improve emergency healthcare by enabling faster and more accurate responses.
